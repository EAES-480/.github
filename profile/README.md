Welcome to EAES 480: Modern Statistics in Earth and Environmental Sciences!

Unit Course Materials on Github Repos:

- In-Class Exercises (e.g., e-01-carbon-emissions) - not graded!
- Labs (complete in class) (e.g., lab-01-hello-r) - graded!

**Steps to generate your own copy of the course materials for each Unit**:

-   Click on the Github repository you want to create your own copy of (e.g., `unit-1`)
-   From the repository landing page, add '/generate' to the end of the url and hit return/enter. OR click the green "Use this Template" button.
-   Skip down to **Owner** and choose `EAES-480`. **Do NOT choose your own account!**
-   Under **Repository Name** enter `unit-X-yourlastname`. E.g., I would enter `unit-1-mcnicol` for Unit 1.
-   You can ignore the **Description** box.
-   Make sure your own repo is **Private**. It should be private by default.
-   Click **Create Repository** and you will be redirected to your generated repo.

**Steps to copy your generated repo into an RStudioCloud Project and open instructions**:

-   Copy the URL of the repo you created using the green `Code` button
-   Copy/clone it into a `New Project from a GitHub Repo` in [RStudio Cloud](rstudio.cloud).
-   Navigate to the exercise, lab, or homework folder using the `File` pane.
-   Open the R Markdown instructions `lab-X-instructions.Rmd` or `hw-X-instructions.Rmd` and, Knit.
